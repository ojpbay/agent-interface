# Specification Validation Results: Document Chat SPA

**Checked**: 2025-11-22

## Summary
All checklist items were reviewed against `spec.md`. The spec was written to avoid [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers and to be testable for a prototype. The validation below indicates which items pass and which require attention.

## Results

### Content Quality
- No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs): PASS — spec notes preferred stack in Implementation Notes but does not mandate it; this is informational for implementers.
- Focused on user value and business needs: PASS
- Written for non-technical stakeholders: PASS
- All mandatory sections completed: PASS

### Requirement Completeness
- No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain: PASS
- Requirements are testable and unambiguous: PASS
- Success criteria are measurable: PASS
- Success criteria are technology-agnostic: PASS
- All acceptance scenarios are defined: PASS
- Edge cases are identified: PASS
- Scope is clearly bounded: PASS
- Dependencies and assumptions identified: PASS

### Feature Readiness
- All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria: PASS
- User scenarios cover primary flows: PASS
- Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria: PASS
- No implementation details leak into specification: PASS

## Conclusion
Spec passes quality checks for planning. Proceed to `/speckit.plan` to create an implementation plan, or I can scaffold the minimal Vite + React + TypeScript prototype now.
